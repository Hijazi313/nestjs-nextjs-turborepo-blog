## Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Blog Project Monorepo

### Overview

The blog project is designed as a full-stack application utilizing a monorepo setup with Turborepo. It combines Next.js 15 for the frontend and NestJS for the backend, leveraging TypeScript, GraphQL, REST APIs, and Tailwind CSS/Shadcn for styling. This document outlines the project's objectives, phases, in-scope features, out-of-scope features, industry best practices to be followed.

### Objectives

- **Primary Objective**: Develop a scalable and maintainable blog platform that showcases articles on various topics.
- **Secondary Objective**: Demonstrate expertise in using Next.js 15 and NestJS within a monorepo setup.
- **Tertiary Objective**: Ensure high-quality user experience through efficient design principles.

### Phases

1. **Phase 1: Planning & Setup**

   - Define project structure using Turborepo.
   - Set up Next.js 15 frontend with Tailwind CSS/Shadcn.
   - Configure NestJS backend with GraphQL and REST support.
   - Establish consistent coding standards across both applications (e.g., linting rules).
   - Conduct initial team training on new technologies if necessary.

2. **Phase 2: Backend Development**
   - Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT) with password hashing/salting.
   - Develop models for posts (articles), comments, users using TypeORM or similar ORM tools.
   - Create GraphQL schemas/resolvers for querying/mutating data efficiently.
   - Implement REST endpoints where necessary (e.g., file uploads).
3. **Phase 3: Frontend Development**

   - Design UI components using React Server Components or Client Components as needed to optimize performance.
   - Integrate data fetching from backend APIs into frontend components securely (using HTTPS).
   - Implement routing using Next.js file system routing; ensure SEO-friendly URLs.

4. **Phase 4: Testing & Deployment**

   - Write unit tests/integration tests/end-to-end tests for critical functionality on both sides of the application to ensure reliability.
   - Deploy application to production environment (e.g., Vercel); configure CI/CD pipelines if possible.

5. **Phase 5: Maintenance & Enhancement**
   - Monitor performance issues or bugs post-deployment; use tools like Sentry or New Relic if available.
   - Gather feedback from users through surveys/forms; improve UI/UX or add new features based on feedback analysis.

| Commenting System    | Users can comment on posts; comments are displayed below each post                |
| Search Functionality | Basic search bar allowing users to find specific articles by keyword/title/author |
| Responsive Design    | Application is fully responsive across desktop/tablet/mobile devices              |

### Out-of-Scope Features

- Advanced SEO optimization beyond basic meta tags
- Integration with third-party services like newsletters or payment gateways
- Complex analytics beyond basic page views/user tracking
- Support for multiple languages beyond English
- Advanced AI-driven content suggestions/recommendations

### Industry Best Practices

1. **Code Organization**: Use modular architecture; organize code by functional areas/features within each app directory (`apps/frontend`, `apps/backend`).
2. **Testing Strategy**: Employ comprehensive testing including unit tests/integration tests/end-to-end tests across both applications.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain detailed documentation of monorepo structure/conventions/workflows.
4. **Collaboration Tools**: Utilize tools like Slack/Microsoft Teams for team communication.
5. **Security Measures**:

   - Use HTTPS throughout the application to secure data transmission between client-server interactions.
   - Regularly update dependencies to prevent vulnerabilities.

6. **_Code Reviews_**:
   - Conduct regular code reviews among team members before merging pull requests into main branches.

By following this PRD and adhering to industry best practices, we aim to deliver a high-quality blog platform that showcases our expertise in full-stack development while providing an engaging user experience through efficient design principles and robust technology stack integration.

**Missing Points Considered**:

1. **_CI/CD Pipelines_**: While mentioned briefly under deployment phase improvements could include setting up automated build/test/deploy processes early in development stages rather than just at deployment time.

2.**_Error Handling_**: Include strategies for handling errors gracefully at both frontend/backend levels ensuring minimal impact on user experience.

3.**_Accessibility Standards_**: Ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines such as WCAG standards during UI component design.
